Basic analysis of wavelengths provided by different sources and different techniques, that goes from Fourier transform and frequency spectrumThe principle of spectral analysis is that any signal can be decomposed into a combination of different frequencies. To do this, the decomposition can be carried out using the Fourier transform (in this case we use FFT), which converts a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.
